4 x 36 cell (4 sessions of 10 repeats x 36 stimulus conditions)

within each cell, we find a matrix:

10 repeats x # neurons

where each value is the mean dF/F for each trial (presentation).

4 x 36 cell (4 sessions of 10 repeats x 36 stimulus conditions)

within each cell, we find a tensor:
# frames x # neurons x # repeats (including 1 sec before and after stimulus)
