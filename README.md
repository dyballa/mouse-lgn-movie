# mouse-lgn-movie
The `frames` folder contains all frames (7,560) in the movie. It is supposed to be diplayed at 60 fps, so the total time should be close to 126 seconds. Trial length 1.5 s / ISI length 2s.


`stim_frames.txt` is a list of all stimuli and their respective onset frame numbers.

`load_images.m` is a Matlab script to load all frames into a matlab array --> needs to be tested! there's also an option to create an .avi movie from the frames, in case that's more convenient (currently commented out).

Please ignore the other files; they contain information about how the movie was generated.
