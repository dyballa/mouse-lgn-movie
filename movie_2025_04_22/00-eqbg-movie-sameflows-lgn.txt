###ALL STIMULI###
trialLenSec 1.5 #Trial length (stimulus presentation), in seconds.
preStimLenSec 3.0 #Pre-stimulus interval (for best results should be at least 1 sec)
postStimLenSec 0. #Post-stimulus interval. Note: Total time spent per trial is given by preStimLenSec + trialLenSec +  postStimLenSec

nTrialBlocks 2 #Number of blocks of trials (i.e., repetitions of each combination of parameters)

nDirs 8 #Number of principal directions (evenly divided around 360 degrees)
tempFreq 4 #Temporal frequency (cycles/s), can choose multiple
nFadeFrames 0 #Sets number of frames used for fade-in/out transitions (0 for no fade)

###FLOW STIMULI###
useFlows 1 #Whether to display flows
nDots 1 3 #Number of dots used in the flow elements, can choose multiple

dotFgVal 8 248 #Grayscale value for foreground (dots) [0-255], multiple
->dotBgVal 128 128 #Grayscale value for background
->dotInterVal 128 128 #Grayscale value of interstimulus screen (use -1 for avg screen luminance of the stimulus)

dotDiamDeg 2 #Diameter of single dots (degs), multiple -- determines diams for other nDots (preserving const. area)
->dotSpacing 2 2 #avg spacing between flow element centers (in multiples of dotDiamDeg), must set a val for each dotDiamDeg used above
#->dotSpatFreq 0.7 1. #Optional: if provided, will be used to compute accurate temp. freq.

rigidTrans 0 #Set to 1 for a rigid translation of the flow elements, i.e., no "jitter" -- no motion components other than main direction of motion (constant parallel flow field and no separation force during trial)
sepWeight 1.5 #Ratio between repulsion force between elts and the flow field force -- should be at least 1.5 for best results, and might need some adjustment for different dot sizes
maxForce 0.04
tileSize 2. #Tile size of the underlying vector field, in multiples of 
dirStd 0.09 #Std. dev. of the direction distribution of the underlying flow field
posStd 0.1 #Std. dev. of initial position of dots on screen, as a fraction of dotSpacing
equalArea 1 #Whether to adjust the diameter of patterns with nDots > 1 so as to preserve the same total area as that of single dots -- default: yes (1)
fixRandState 0 #Set to 1 to make identical all trials of the same flow variation (fixes the initial dot positions and flow field)
sameFlows 1

###GRATINGS STIMULI###
useGratings 1 #Whether to display square-wave gratings
gratWidthDeg 12.5 2 #Width of grating bars, in degrees of visual angle, i.e. 1/(2*spat.freq.)
randGratPhase 0 #Set to 1 to enable random initial phase in each trial
gratFgVal 68 #Grayscale value of one half of the bars ("foreground") [0-255], can choose multiple
->gratBgVal 188 #Grayscale value of the other half of the bars ("background")
->gratInterVal 128 #Grayscale value of interstimulus screen (use -1 for avg screen luminance of the stimulus)
